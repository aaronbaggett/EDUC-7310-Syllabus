<!-- Your culminating assignment/project in EDAD 7310 will be comprised of an abridged, rough sketch version of your dissertation's introduction section (chapter 1).

<!-- The following pages contain the eight sections you will address in the Chapter 1 in a Nutshell assignment. Each section contains a brief description of how you should address each section. In brief, the eight sections you will address are: -->

<!-- 1.	Research Problem -->

<!-- 5.	Variables -->

<!-- I realize this assignment may feel a little daunting for some of you. Not to worry. Again, the more familiar you can be with your planned dissertation research now, the better off you will be both during your oral qualifying exam as well as your dissertation proposal presentation. <!-- *A detailed submission template and grading rubric will be provided*. -->
