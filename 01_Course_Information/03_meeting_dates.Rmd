<!-- **A Note About This Semester** -->

<!-- Since Research I is designed to outline and introduce students to the basics of educational research using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we will be dividing the course content  into 2 separate two-week segments.  -->

<!-- To accomplish this, students with last names starting with I-Z will meet with Dr. Nguyen in PAC 223 on both Saturday, September 12 and Saturday, October 03. Likewise, students with last names A-H will meet with Dr. Baggett in PAC 222 for those dates. Beginning with the October 24 sessions, the groups will then flip, with I-Z joining Dr. Baggett in PAC 214 and A-H joining Dr. Nguyen. -->

<!-- Finally, all students will then complete a culminating assignment (details TBA) during the final class session of the semester, Saturday, December 05, 2020. Because of the need to social distance, I-Z will remain in PAC 214 with Dr. Baggett, while A-H will remain with Dr. Nguyen in PAC 223. -->
