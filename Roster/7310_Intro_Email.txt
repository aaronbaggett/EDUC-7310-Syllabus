Good evening Research I,

I'm really looking forward to meeting and getting to know you this semester during EDUC 7310: Research I. As you know, this semester will be a little different from previous semesters so please read the following ahead of our first day of class, Saturday, September 12 at 1:30 PM.

CANVAS
You may have noticed that our Canvas course page has been temporarily unpublished. I'm still making a few CruFlex-related adjustments to our syllabus and course materials. I will have everything fully operational by this Friday, August 21.


ATTENDANCE METHOD
In the meantime, please let me know how you plan to attend EDUC 7310 this semester:
1. Face-to-face
2. Online


REMIND
In situations where it would be more efficient for me to get in touch with the class  immediately, I will communicate with you through a free, safe, and one-way text messaging service called Remind. To sign up for these alerts, text @educ7310a to 81010 and follow the instructions. If you have trouble with this method, try texting @educ7310a to (254) 296-8301.

We're going to have a great semester. Looking forward to seeing you soon,

Dr. Baggett
